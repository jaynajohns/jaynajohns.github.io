      Born on July 12 in the great<em>ish</em> state of <strong>Texas</strong>, I would become the loudest quiet person <em>ever</em>. I stood out from my brothers and sister in that I <em>didn't</em> stand out. You could forget about <strong>me</strong>; you couldn't forget about <strong>them</strong>. But when I speak, I'm heard...<em>usually</em>. Even the quietest raised in such a <strong>boisterous</strong> group can't help but pick up <em>some</em> of their characteristics - and the enigma that is the <strong>quiet girl</strong> who won't stop trying to talk <strong>over people</strong> will forever baffle and amuse - and <em>maybe</em> occasionally frustrate - those around me. <strong>This will become a brief, professional autobiography when inspiration properly strikes.</strong>
